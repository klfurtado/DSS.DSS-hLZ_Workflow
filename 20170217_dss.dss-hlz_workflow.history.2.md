# DSS/DSS-hLZ Workflow and History (Part 2)

**Fastq_screen troubleshooting**

Confirmed that bowtie2-build did indeed build the correct indexes, by running ```bowtie2-inspect``` within the directories where the bowtie2 indexes are kept (pig.mt/ and phi.x.174/ )

Usage:

```
bowtie2-inspect -v pig.mt
bowtie2-inspect -v phi.x.174
```

**Fastq_screen troubleshooting**

Tried adjusting the filepath in the configuration file for bowtie2 aligner. Nothing else in the .conf file was changed.

New .conf file changes:

```
# This is an example configuration file for FastQ Screen

############################
## Bowtie, Bowtie 2 or BWA #
############################
## If the Bowtie, Bowtie 2 or BWA binary is not in your PATH, you can set
## this value to tell the program where to find your chosen aligner.  Uncomment
## the relevant line below and set the appropriate location.  Please note,
## this path should INCLUDE the executable filename.

#BOWTIE	/usr/local/bin/bowtie/bowtie
BOWTIE2 module load bowtie2/2.2.8
#BWA /usr/local/bwa/bwa
```

Edited ```dss.fastq.screen.sh``` script to remove FastQC steps until fastq_screen is completely fixed.
